of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in Pune, India. C-
DAC embarked on its first High Performance 
Computing (HPC) mission in 1988. Since then, it has 
delivered a series of supercomputing systems called 
PARAM series of supercomputers. These include:  
• PARAM 8000, India's 1st Giga-scale supercomputer 
in 1990. 
• PARAM 10000, 100 Gigaflop supercomputer in 1998. 
• PARAM Padma, 1-Teraflop supercomputer in 2002. 
 This was India's first supercomputer to enter the Top 
500 list of supercomputers of the world (ranked 171 in 
June 2003). 
• PARAM Yuva, a 54 Teraflop supercomputer in 2008 
(ranked 69 in November 2008). 
• PARAM Yuva II, a 529 Teraflop supercomputer in 
2013 (ranked 69 in June 2013) 
• PARAM Biochrome is an HPC cluster for Bioinf-
ormatics applications. The cluster has a computing 
capacity of 5 Teraflops. 
• PARAM Bio-Blaze: A supercomputing facility with 
peak compute power of 10.65 TF, was launched on 
February 18, 2014 to address the challenges in 
bioinformatics.</div>
